# Yellow Adapter - Real-Time Influencer Payments

## 🎯 What is Yellow?

Yellow is a **real-time payment streaming platform** that connects brands with influencers through performance-based compensation. Influencers get paid **instantly** as their content drives real results.

## 📊 How It Works

### The Flow

1. **Brands** create campaigns and set payment rules:
   - `$X` per video view
   - `$X` per add-to-cart action
   - `$X` per checkout completion

2. **Yellow Platform** acts as the central orchestrator:
   - Tracks all user actions in real-time
   - Calculates payments instantly
   - Streams money to influencers automatically

3. **Influencers** create and share content:
   - Apply to brand campaigns
   - Create engaging videos
   - Share product links with their audience

4. **Users** interact with content:
   - Watch videos
   - Add products to cart
   - Complete purchases

5. **Payment Flow** happens automatically:
   - Action detected → Yellow processes → **Instant payment** → Influencer paid
